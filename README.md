## üìñ Usage

### Basic Tracking

```bash
# Start tracking (runs in background)

- **Daily Goal Progress**: Visual progress bar with percentage
- **Today's Summary**: Work/idle breakdown with focus statistics
- **Tag Analytics**: Hours breakdown by project/activity tags for day/week/month
- **30-Day Overview**: Visual calendar showing productivity patterns
- **Best/Worst Days**: Highest and lowest productivity days
- **Period Goals**: Week, month, and year progress tracking with visual indicators
- **Live Timeline**: Real-time activity blocks with durations
- **Live Status**: Current activity state (Active/Idle with duration)

### Reports

```bash
# Today's detailed report
./timetrackcli --report

# Weekly report (current week, Monday-Sunday)
./timetrackcli --report --range=week

# Monthly report (current month)
./timetrackcli --report --range=month

# Yearly report (current year, monthly breakdown)
./timetrackcli --report --range=year
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Background Operation

The tool is designed to run continuously in the background. When started, it:
1. Samples activity every 30 seconds
2. Groups time into 5-minute bins
3. Automatically saves data
4. Optimizes storage by compacting old data into ranges

### Data Storage

- **Location**: `./timetrackcli.json` (or custom path via `--file`)
- **Format**: JSON with automatic compression
- **Privacy**: All data stays local, no network requests
- **Backup**: Consider backing up your JSON file periodically
- **Tags**: Stored as part of time ranges with searchable tag list


### Performance

- **CPU Usage**: Minimal (samples every 30 seconds)
- **Memory**: Low footprint (~5-10MB)
- **Storage**: Efficient compression keeps files small long-term
- **Battery**: Negligible impact on battery life

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Permissions Issues
If tracking isn't working:
1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy
2. Click "Accessibility" 
3. Add your terminal app and/or the `timetrackcli` binary
4. Restart the tracking

### Data Recovery
```bash
# Check if data file exists and is valid
cat timetrackcli.json | jq .

# Backup your data
cp timetrackcli.json backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Common Issues

**"HIDIdleTime not found" error**: Ensure you have Accessibility permissions granted.

**No data showing**: Check that the tool has been running and permissions are correct.

**Large file sizes**: The tool automatically compacts data, but very old installations might benefit from manually backing up and starting fresh.
